# EasternCaribbean100pctRE
Repository for Jupyter notebooks and output files, plus additional input data for the paper "Transmission Links and Storage for Eastern Caribbean Islands to Enable 100% Renewable Electricity" with lead author Olyvia Green

Input files are included for the hourly electricity demand in each country, scaled from openly available data from Martinique and with random noise added to each data set.

The collected summary of output data is included in the spreadsheet Eastern_Caribbean_outputs_final.

A worksheet used to calculate battery storage costs is included as well.

In each of the sub-folders, results from all scenarios in each Scenario Set (as described in the paper) are included. Also in these folders are the Jupyter notebooks used for running the scenario optimizations.
